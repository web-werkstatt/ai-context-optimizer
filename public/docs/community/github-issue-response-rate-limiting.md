# GitHub Issue Response: VS Code LM API Rate Limiting with Claude

## Response Draft

---

Thanks for raising this issue! I've been working with the VS Code LM API and Claude integration extensively, and you're hitting a common challenge that many developers face.

### Understanding the Rate Limiting

What you're experiencing is Claude's rate limiting, which is separate from token limits. Claude implements several rate limiting tiers:

- **Request limits**: Number of API calls per minute
- **Token throughput limits**: Tokens per minute (TPM)
- **Concurrent request limits**: Simultaneous active requests

The VS Code LM API doesn't currently expose fine-grained control over request timing, which can lead to burst patterns that trigger these limits.

### Practical Solutions

Here are some approaches that have worked well in production:

1. **Request Spacing Implementation**
   ```typescript
   // Simple request queue with spacing
   class RequestQueue {
     private queue: Array<() => Promise<any>> = [];
     private processing = false;
     private minDelay = 1000; // 1 second between requests
     
     async add(request: () => Promise<any>) {
       this.queue.push(request);
       if (!this.processing) this.process();
     }
     
     private async process() {
       this.processing = true;
       while (this.queue.length > 0) {
         const request = this.queue.shift();
         await request();
         await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, this.minDelay));
       }
       this.processing = false;
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Implement Exponential Backoff**
   ```typescript
   async function withRetry(fn: () => Promise<any>, maxRetries = 3) {
     for (let i = 0; i < maxRetries; i++) {
       try {
         return await fn();
       } catch (error) {
         if (error.code === 'rate_limit_exceeded' && i < maxRetries - 1) {
           const delay = Math.pow(2, i) * 1000; // 1s, 2s, 4s
           await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, delay));
         } else {
           throw error;
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

3. **API Key Rotation Strategy**
   If you have multiple API keys (e.g., for different projects), you can implement rotation:
   ```typescript
   class ApiKeyManager {
     private keys: string[] = process.env.CLAUDE_API_KEYS?.split(',') || [];
     private currentIndex = 0;
     
     getNextKey(): string {
       const key = this.keys[this.currentIndex];
       this.currentIndex = (this.currentIndex + 1) % this.keys.length;
       return key;
     }
   }
   ```

### Optimization Strategies

Beyond rate limiting, optimizing your API usage can help stay within limits:

1. **Context Window Management**: Carefully manage what context you send with each request
2. **Request Batching**: Combine multiple small requests when possible
3. **Caching**: Implement smart caching for repeated queries
4. **Token Estimation**: Pre-calculate token usage to avoid unnecessary large requests

*Note: There are some community tools emerging that help with token optimization and usage tracking. For instance, I've been working on a token management extension that provides real-time monitoring and helps identify optimization opportunities. While it won't solve rate limiting directly, understanding your usage patterns can help you better manage your API calls.*

### Workaround for VS Code LM API

Until the VS Code team adds native rate limiting controls, you might consider:

```typescript
// Wrapper for VS Code LM API calls
class RateLimitedLMClient {
  private lastRequestTime = 0;
  private minRequestInterval = 1000; // ms
  
  async sendRequest(messages: any[], options: any) {
    const now = Date.now();
    const timeSinceLastRequest = now - this.lastRequestTime;
    
    if (timeSinceLastRequest < this.minRequestInterval) {
      await new Promise(resolve => 
        setTimeout(resolve, this.minRequestInterval - timeSinceLastRequest)
      );
    }
    
    this.lastRequestTime = Date.now();
    return vscode.lm.sendRequest(messages, options);
  }
}
```

### Long-term Solutions

Consider advocating for these features in the VS Code LM API:
- Native rate limiting configuration
- Request queue management
- Built-in retry mechanisms
- Rate limit header exposure
