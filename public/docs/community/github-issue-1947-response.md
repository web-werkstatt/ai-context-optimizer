## Response Text:

I've been tracking this exact issue and can confirm what you're experiencing. The Claude 3.7 models definitely support much higher token limits than the 8192 being displayed.

### Technical Analysis

The issue appears to be related to the missing `anthropic-beta` headers that enable the higher output limits. Specifically, Claude 3.7 Sonnet should support up to 128K output tokens when the proper beta headers are included in the API requests:

```
anthropic-beta: output-128k-2025-02-19
```

Without these headers, the API defaults to the standard 8192 token limit, which is what you're seeing in Cline's interface.

### Verification

You can verify this is the issue by comparing:
- **OpenRouter**: Shows correct 128K limits for Claude 3.7
- **Direct Anthropic API**: Supports 128K with beta headers
- **Cline**: Currently shows 8192 (missing headers)

### Solution Approach

This is a common pattern I've seen across multiple AI coding tools - they often lag behind the latest API capabilities. The fix requires updating the API client implementation to include the proper beta headers.

For developers hitting this limitation frequently, there are a few approaches:
1. **Temporary workaround**: Switch to OpenRouter which has the correct limits
2. **Manual patching**: Modify Cline's API client (though this breaks with updates)
3. **Automated solution**: Use tools that can automatically detect and fix these token limit issues

I've actually been working on a VS Code extension that addresses exactly this problem - it can automatically detect when Cline has incorrect token limits and apply the necessary fixes with backup protection. The extension handles the anthropic-beta header requirements and restores the correct 128K limits.

### For the Cline Team

It would be great to see this addressed in a future Cline update. The implementation should include:
- Adding the `anthropic-beta: output-128k-2025-02-19` header for Claude 3.7 requests
- Updating the UI to display the correct 128K token limits
- Ensuring compatibility with future Anthropic beta features

Hope this helps clarify the technical issue! The community would definitely benefit from having this resolved officially.
